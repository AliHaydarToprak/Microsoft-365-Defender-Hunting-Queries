# Gootkit malware delivery and C2

This query was originally published on Twitter, by [@MsftSecIntel](https://twitter.com/MsftSecIntel).

Gootkit is malware that started life as a banking trojan, and has since extended its capabilities to allow for a variety of malicious activities.

The query helps find events related to Gootkit downloads and command-and-control behavior.

## Query

``` Kusto
// Surface suspicious create file events related to malicious download URLs
let CF = DeviceFileEvents
// Check for pattern match used by attacker
| where FileOriginUrl matches regex @"down.php\?(?:id=|\w{6,8}=\w{5,7}&id=)(?:\w+&\w{6,7}=\w{5}|\w{112,})"
| summarize by  FolderPath, FileSize, SHA256, DeviceId, Timestamp, InitiatingProcessFileName, FileOriginUrl, FileOriginReferrerUrl;
////////
// Next section surfaces active follow-on Command and Control as a result of the preceding behavior. Comment out the join on line 10
// to view only those file create events where the malware may be present but not yet been executed.
////
DeviceNetworkEvents | join CF on $left.DeviceId == $right.DeviceId
| where InitiatingProcessFileName =~ "wscript.exe" and InitiatingProcessCommandLine has ".zip" and InitiatingProcessCommandLine has ".js"
| summarize by RemoteUrl, RemoteIP , DeviceId, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, FolderPath, FileSize, SHA256, Timestamp, 
InitiatingProcessFileName, FileOriginUrl, FileOriginReferrerUrl
```
